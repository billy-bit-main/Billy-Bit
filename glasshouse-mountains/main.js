      <div class="paragraphs">

      Mount Beerwah, the highest of Queensland's Glass House Mountains, is a 556-meter-high volcanic plug,

      one of ten in the range, formed about 26 million years ago. It's known for its two peaks, dramatic

      <em>"Organ Pipes"</em> cliff face, and small caves at its base. The mountain is considered sacred by the Jinibara people,

      who have traditional stories and customs asking people not to climb it out of respect for its spiritual significance.

    <h3>Key Facts</h3>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Mount Coonowrin is an extinct volcanic plug, formed from molten rock that cooled millions of years ago. </li><br>

      <li><strong>Height:</strong> It rises to 377 meters (1,237 feet) above sea level.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> It is easily recognizable by its unique, jagged, and steep profile, which gives it the unofficial name "Crookneck". </li><br>

      <li><strong>Access Restrictions:</strong> Climbing is prohibited due to safety concerns following rockfalls and erosion. Fines apply for unauthorized access.</li>

    </ul>

 

    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Aboriginal Heritage:</strong> Mount Coonowrin is of great cultural and spiritual importance to the local Traditional Owners, the Jinibara and Kabi Kabi First Nations. </li><br>

      <li><strong>Aboriginal Legend:</strong> An Aboriginal tale describes Coonowrin as the son of Tibrogargan (the father) and Beerwah (the mother) who failed to rescue his mother from rising waters, leading to his father striking him and "breaking his neck". </li>

    </ul>

 

    <h3>Access and Safety</h3>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Restricted Area:</strong> Since March 1999, Mount Coonowrin has been a Restricted Access Area under the Nature Conservation Act 1992. </li><br>

      <li><strong>Public Safety:</strong> The restriction is in place for public safety, as climbing is considered highly dangerous and can lead to death or serious injury. </li><br>

      <li><strong>Fines:</strong> Unauthorized entry into the restricted area results in on-the-spot fines.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Views:</strong> The summit offers spectacular 360° views of the surrounding area.</li>

    </ul>

 

    <h3>Geological Significance</h3>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Mount Coonowrin is an intrusive plug—remnant of volcanic activity that occurred approximately 25-27 million years ago.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> It is easily recognizable by its unique, jagged, and steep profile, which gives it the unofficial name "Crookneck". Millions of years of erosion have removed the surrounding exteriors of the volcanic cones and softer sandstone rocks, leaving the magnificent landscape features you see today. Interesting vertical columns that formed as the volcanic mountains cooled can be seen at Mount Beerwah and Mount Ngungun.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Molten rock filled small vents or intruded as bodies beneath the surface and solidified into hard rocks—trachyte and rhyolite.</li>

  "Mount Ngungun":`

    <p>  <div class="paragraphs">

      Mount Ngungun is a popular 253-meter-high peak in Queensland's Glass House Mountains National Park, offering a 2.8km return walk with spectacular panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and the coast. The climb is suitable for most fitness levels, takes about two hours, features a rock overhang or 'cave' along the way, and is managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.
